### Planning Story

This project came into mind when a colleague brought up the idea of needing a way to formulate a workout when they may just not know what to do, or challenge themselves in an unknown way.

The main purpose of this application was to randomize a workout based on a specific muscle/workout category. For version 1.0 this method would use one category to request the randomized response and a set number of exercises (5, set on the backend). From here the next step was to design a way to log the workout created, because what use is an application if it just needs another workout tracker to function amazingly.

Unfortunately some ideas initially intended to be ready for release had to be postponed. Still they are not far off from being completed. Structure is in place for these features to be finished and added.

##### Future Goals:

- Customize messages for success and errors
- Develop a flow of design for the site, working over fonts and color patterns
- Add a way to create custom workouts, not just from the randomizer
- Utilize Chart.js to display relevant information about workouts logged/created
